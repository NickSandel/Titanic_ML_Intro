Titanic data notes initial thoughts:
- Train name is slightly deceiving as it'll need splitting into train and test sets so I can use labelled data to verify the training
- Age has gaps - probably want to use a median or mean. Perhaps even paying attention to gender
- Want to pull out mr, mrs, miss, master from the name as I think it could help - might help pin down missing ages to band into children/adult flags?
- Ticket does not appear to be useful (could be wrong!)
- Parch can help determine children as they're more likely to have parents on board than older people - could their survival rates be higher?
- Classification problem, doubt linear things will help at all
- pclass and fare are likely well correlated
- probably worth turning things like age and fare into categories
- Really wonder if embarked influences survival?
- Cabin is sparsely populated - I expect it's related to ticket price and class. Perhaps a default value here

Project steps:
- Look at the data and attempt some analysis steps using what was learned in Chapter 2 (copy!)
- Check out train/test split
- Transformations
- Attempt some ML algorithms
- Read classification chapter and examples as I suspect that'll be most relevant for this problem
